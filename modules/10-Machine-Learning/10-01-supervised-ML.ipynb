    "Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to identify patterns and make predictions from data with minimal human intervention. In drug discovery, ML algorithms can analyze vast datasets of chemical structures, biological activities, and pharmacokinetic properties to predict which compounds are likely to be effective drugs. Applications include virtual screening of compound libraries, prediction of drug-target interactions, identification of potential toxicity, and optimization of lead compounds through structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling. By accelerating these processes, ML helps reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem, well-suited for binary feature vectors such as molecular fingerprints. In cheminformatics, it is often applied to classify molecules (e.g., active vs. inactive) based on structural features represented as binary indicators — such as the presence or absence of specific substructures captured by MACCS keys or other molecular fingerprints. The algorithm assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label and models each feature using a Bernoulli (0 or 1) distribution. During training, it learns the likelihood of each structural feature being present within each class. Despite its simplicity and the strong independence assumption, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes is efficient and effective for high-dimensional molecular data, making it a useful baseline model for structure-activity classification tasks."
