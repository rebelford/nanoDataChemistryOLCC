    "Now, let's perform similarity search against PubChem using each known active compound as a query.  There are a few things to mention in this step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SMILES were obtained from the DUD-E database. Since there are multiple ways to generate SMILES, PubChem will run an algorithm to convert the SMILES in the query to the SMILES in the PubChem database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SMILES string is available for each query compound. This string will be used to specify the input structure, so HTTP POST should be used.  (Please review lecture02-structure-inputs.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "- During PubChem's similarity search, molecular similarity is evaluated using the **PubChem fingerprints** and **Tanimoto** coefficient.  By default, similarity search will return compounds with Tanimoto scores of **0.9 or higher**.  While we will use the default threshold in this practice, it is noteworthy that it is adjustable.  If you use a higher threshold (e.g., 0.99), you will get a fewer hits, which are too similar to the query compounds.  If you use a lower threshold (e.g., 0.88), you will get more hits, but they will include more false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- PubChem's similarity search does **not** return the similarity scores between the query and hit compounds.  Only the hit compound list is returned, which makes it difficult to rank the hit compounds for compound selection.  To address this issue, for each hit compound, we compute **the number of query compounds that returned that compound as a hit.**  \\[Because we are using multiple query compounds for similarity search, it is possible for different query compounds to return the same compound as a hit.  That is, the hit compound may be similar to multiple query compounds.  The underlying assumption is that hit compounds returned multiple times from different queries are more likely to be active than those returned only once from a single query.\\]\n",
