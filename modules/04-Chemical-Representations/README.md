# Module3: Chemical Representation
This directory is set up to develop a variety of Python tutorials to assist students in learning Python skills they will use in later modules. Discussions of these tutorials will take place in the [Chemical Representation GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/DivCHED-CCCE/DataChemistryOLCC/discussions/categories/03-chemical-representation). Please contact Bob Belford (rebelford@ualr.edu) if you would like to join the working group, contribute content to this repository, or have any questions or concerns about this project.

## Notebooks


### 03-03-Introduction-Chemical-Representations
[Vhemical Representations and Introduction to RDKit](https://github.com/DivCHED-CCCE/DataChemistryOLCC/blob/main/module-development/03-Chemical-Representations/03-01-introduction_chemical_representations.ipynb). This notebook is inspired by and borrows from [Chapter 15: Cheminformatics with RDKit](https://weisscharlesj.github.io/SciCompforChemists/notebooks/chapter_015/chap_15_notebook.html) of Charlie Weiss's book [ScintiAn Introduction to the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PatWalters/practical_cheminformatics_tutorials/blob/main/fundamentals/SMILES_tutorial.ipynb) from Pat Walter's [Cheminformatics Tutorials GitHub](https://github.com/PatWalters/practical_cheminformatics_tutorials?tab=readme-ov-file). Contact Ehren Bucholtz (ehren.Bucholtz@uhsp.edu) if you want access to the key.
