# Module 8: Molecular Similarity

# Module 1: Introduction
This directory is set up to develop supporting activities to assist students in the first module of the DataChemistry OLCC. Discussions of this module will take place in the [08_Molecular_Similarity Forum](https://nanohub.org/groups/ccce/forum/module-development/8-molecular-similarity) of the Module Development category of the nanoHUB [CCCE OLCC Working Group](https://nanohub.org/groups/ccce/forum). Please contact Bob Belford (rebelford@ualr.edu) if you would like to join the working group, contribute content to this repository, or have any questions or concerns about this project.

## Notebooks

### 08_1(a-c) Molecular Similarity
These three notebooks are modifications of the 2019 Cheminformatics OLCC lecture 6 on Molecular Similarity originally developed by Sunghwan Kim. This update is being spearheaded by Ehren Bucholtz (ehren.Bucholts@uhsp.edu) whom you should contact if you want to contribute to this module or be granted access to the keys.
